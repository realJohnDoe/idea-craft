# Progress

## What Works

- The memory bank structure is fully set up with core files documenting the project's context and status.
- The application allows users to create, edit, and delete items (tasks, events, messages, and notes).
- Items are stored in local storage, with support for importing and exporting as markdown files.
- The application features a basic UI with components like Navbar, TypeFilter, TagsFilter, ContentList, and SelectedItemView.
- Type inference from frontmatter is implemented, allowing flexible categorization of items.
- Quick preview for wikilinks is functional when typing `[[`, with automatic closing braces.
- Frontmatter attributes are now more obviously editable with always-visible edit icons, adjusted for subtlety.
- Inline tasks are displayed within content for better integration.
- The `AttributeEditor` component and its tests are complete, with all tests passing.
- Test files have been adapted to use `@` imports instead of relative paths for consistency.
- Resolved IDE import recognition issue by adding the `test` directory to `tsconfig.app.json`, ensuring proper alias resolution in the development environment.

## What's Left to Build

- Use the newly created AttributeEditor to factor out duplicate code in ContentBody.tsx.

- Refactor `ContentBody.tsx` into smaller, more manageable files, potentially creating reusable components for `isEditing` blocks.
- Fix the bug where adding a second wikilink in the same editing session inserts characters at the location of the first wikilink.
- Enhance wikilink preview positioning to appear near the cursor, enable browsing suggestions with arrow keys, and implement fuzzy search for adapting suggestions after more characters are typed.
- Develop a markdown editor with a user experience similar to Notion or Obsidian for intuitive content creation and linking.
- Implement a calendar view for events to provide a visual representation of scheduled items.


## Current Status

The project is in an active development phase. Significant progress has been made on user interface enhancements and technical setup:
- Recent update: Fixed IDE import recognition by including the `test` directory in `tsconfig.app.json`, resolving alias resolution errors for test files.
- Phase 1 improvements, such as wikilink previews, enhanced frontmatter editing visibility, and inline task display, are largely complete.

## Known Issues

- None at this time related to `lucide-react`; the import issue has been resolved.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project has evolved to prioritize a unified experience for managing different types of items, with flexible type inference from frontmatter.
- Recent updates have focused on user interface improvements for better content interaction, such as wikilink previews and editable attributes.
- Decided to use `@` aliases in test imports for consistency with the rest of the codebase, resolving IDE issues through configuration adjustments.
- Temporarily disabled `lucide-react` imports to make tests pass, with a plan to revisit the dependency resolution issue for a permanent fix.
