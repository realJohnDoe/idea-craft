# Progress

## What Works

- The memory bank structure is set up.
- The core files have been created.
- The application allows users to create, edit, and delete items (tasks, events, messages, and notes).
- Items are stored in local storage.
- The application has a basic UI with a Navbar, TypeFilter, TagsFilter, ContentList, and SelectedItemView.
- The application supports importing items.
- The application infers types from the frontmatter.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement a more robust frontmatter parsing system.
- Implement a very convenient markdown editor with similar UX as Notion or Obsidian.
- Implement a calendar view for events.

## Current Status

The project is in the development phase. The basic functionality is implemented, but there is still work to be done.

## Known Issues

- None.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project has evolved to focus on providing a unified experience for managing different types of items.
