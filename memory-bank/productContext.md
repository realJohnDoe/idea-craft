# Product Context for Idea Craft

## Why This Project Exists
Idea Craft is designed to be a versatile tool for capturing and organizing ideas, tasks, events, messages, and notes in a unified, user-friendly interface. It addresses the frustration of using multiple disconnected productivity tools by offering a single platform where users can manage diverse content types effortlessly, leveraging markdown for flexibility and portability.

## Problems It Solves
- **Fragmentation of Tools:** Many users juggle separate apps for tasks, calendars, messaging, and note-taking. Idea Craft consolidates these functions into one cohesive application, reducing context-switching and improving workflow efficiency.
- **Data Portability:** By using markdown as the core format, Idea Craft ensures that content is easily exportable and importable, preventing lock-in to proprietary formats and enabling seamless integration with other systems or workflows.
- **Accessibility Across Devices:** Idea Craft aims to be accessible on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets, allowing users to manage their content anytime, anywhere, with a consistent experience regardless of platform.

## How It Should Work
- **Unified Content Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete items categorized as tasks, events, messages, or notes, with type inference from frontmatter for flexible organization without rigid schemas.
- **Intuitive Interface:** The app provides a clean, responsive UI with components like filters for tags and types, a content list for browsing, and a detailed view for selected items, ensuring ease of navigation and interaction.
- **Markdown Integration:** Content is managed in markdown format, supporting features like wikilinks for internal referencing and frontmatter for metadata, enhancing content structure and connectivity between ideas.
- **Local Storage:** Data is initially stored in the browser's local storage to maintain simplicity and ensure access to content even without an internet connection, prioritizing offline usability.
- **Data Import and Export:** Users can import markdown files to populate their content library and export their data as markdown, maintaining full control over their information for backup or use in other tools.

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamless Interaction:** The app should feel intuitive, with quick access to creating and editing content, supported by features like wikilink previews for linking ideas and easily editable frontmatter attributes for metadata customization.
- **Visual Clarity:** A visually appealing design based on the Atom One Dark theme, using custom colors for a comfortable and focused environment that minimizes distraction during productivity tasks.
- **Content Discoverability:** Filters and previews help users quickly find and connect related content, reducing search time and enhancing productivity through efficient organization and retrieval.
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Make Idea Craft accessible on mobile devices via a home screen shortcut, allowing users to add the web app to their device's home screen for easy access without the complexities of a full PWA setup or app store distribution.
- **Data Portability and Syncing:** Enable users to sync their markdown content with a local directory on their device, ensuring data is portable and manageable outside the app, enhancing flexibility in how and where content is stored or edited.
