# Active Context for Idea Craft Project

## Current Work Focus
- Refactoring memory bank files to remove redundancy and ensure each file serves a distinct purpose, focusing on clear documentation of Idea Craft's direction and status.
- Per user request, concentrating solely on updating memory bank documentation without making code changes at this time.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `projectbrief.md` to provide a high-level overview of goals and scope, avoiding detailed functionality overlap.
- Refined `productContext.md` to focus on user needs, problems solved, and UX goals like mobile accessibility and data syncing.
- Adjusted `systemPatterns.md` to emphasize architecture, component relationships, and design decisions, excluding specific technology details.
- Streamlined `techContext.md` to cover technologies, setup, constraints, and challenges, complementing architectural focus elsewhere.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` if necessary to ensure it remains the comprehensive status tracker with historical context and tasks.
- Ready to address any additional documentation needs or revisit implementation plans for mobile accessibility and directory syncing when requested by the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Current user directive is to focus on memory bank updates only, without proceeding to code implementation.
- Decision to pivot to a non-PWA web app with home screen shortcut support and plan for local directory syncing are documented in relevant files, referenced here for context.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Maintain thorough documentation in the memory bank to ensure continuity and clarity of project direction after memory resets.
- Adhere to distinct roles for each memory bank file to minimize redundancy and improve information accessibility.

This file provides a concise snapshot of the current work focus and immediate context for Idea Craft. For detailed history, technical architecture, or user experience goals, refer to other memory bank files.
