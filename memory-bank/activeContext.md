# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Working on refining the user interface and resolving technical issues related to import resolution in the IDE for test files. The focus is on ensuring a seamless development environment and enhancing user interaction with features like wikilink previews and editable frontmatter attributes.

## Recent Changes

- Resolved IDE import recognition issue by adding the `test` directory to `tsconfig.app.json`, ensuring that test files are processed by TypeScript and aliases are correctly resolved.
- Implemented the `AttributeEditor` component for better frontmatter attribute editing, with corresponding tests passing.
- Adapted test files to use `@` aliases instead of relative paths for consistency.
- Temporarily commented out `lucide-react` imports in components like `AttributeEditor.tsx` to bypass dependency resolution issues during testing.

## Next Steps

- Address the warning about providing a `value` prop to form fields without an `onChange` handler in `AttributeEditor.test.tsx`.
- Refactor `ContentBody.tsx` to split it into smaller, more manageable files and potentially create reusable components for `isEditing` blocks.
- Fix the bug where adding a second wikilink in the same editing session inserts characters at the location of the first wikilink.
- Improve wikilink preview positioning to appear near the cursor and enable browsing suggestions with arrow keys, including fuzzy search for adapting suggestions.
- Investigate a permanent solution for the `lucide-react` import issue, possibly by ensuring correct installation or exploring alternative icon libraries.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- How to best structure the markdown editor to provide a UX similar to Notion or Obsidian for intuitive content creation and linking.
- Whether to continue using `@` aliases in test files or revert to relative paths if IDE issues persist, balancing consistency with practicality.
- How to manage dependencies like `lucide-react` to avoid recurring resolution errors during test runs.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Using markdown files with frontmatter for data storage, allowing for flexible type inference based on attributes.
- Prioritizing small, focused components (e.g., `AttributeEditor`) to enhance maintainability and testability.
- Ensuring test coverage for new UI components to maintain code quality.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Ensuring that TypeScript configuration includes all relevant directories (like `test`) is crucial for IDE support and avoiding import resolution errors.
- Temporary workarounds for dependency issues (e.g., commenting out imports) can unblock development but need documented plans for permanent resolution.
- User interface improvements like inline task display and wikilink previews significantly enhance the user experience, aligning with the goal of a seamless productivity tool.
