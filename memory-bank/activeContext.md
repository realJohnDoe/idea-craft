# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Successfully integrated `AttributeEditor` into `ContentBody.tsx` to remove duplicate code for editing attributes like location, mail from, and mail to.
- All tests are passing after the structural refactoring, confirming no behavioral changes were introduced.
- The task from `progress.md` to use `AttributeEditor` to factor out duplicate code in `ContentBody.tsx` is complete.
- Factored out `EditActions.tsx` as a reusable component for edit actions, furthering the refactoring of `ContentBody.tsx` into smaller, manageable components.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored `ContentBody.tsx` to use `AttributeEditor` for location, mail from, and mail to attributes, reducing code duplication.
- Ran `npm run test` to validate that all tests pass after the integration, maintaining the "Green" state as per TDD principles.
- Factored out `EditActions.tsx` from `ContentBody.tsx` to create a reusable component for edit actions like cancel and save, enhancing code maintainability.
- Removed the alias for `lucide-react` in `vitest.config.ts` to resolve import resolution errors during test runs (from previous updates).
- Uncommented the `Pencil` icon import in `AttributeEditor.tsx` (from previous updates).
- Updated failing tests in `AttributeEditor.test.tsx` to use the correct accessible name for the edit button (from previous updates).
- Added `title="Edit Content"` to the edit button and `title="Content Editor"` to the textarea in `ContentBody.tsx` to improve testability (from previous updates).
- Updated tests in `ContentBody.test.tsx` to use these `title` values for selecting elements, resolving issues with multiple textbox elements (from previous updates).

## Next Steps
- Review `progress.md` for the next task to tackle, potentially addressing the wikilink bug or further refactoring `ContentBody.tsx`.
- Ensure that any further refactoring or feature additions follow TDD and Tidy First principles by separating structural and behavioral changes.
- Maintain the use of `title` attributes for robust test selection in future UI updates.
- Consider creating tests for `EditActions.tsx` to ensure its functionality is covered under the TDD cycle.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The decision to use `AttributeEditor` for attribute editing in `ContentBody.tsx` has proven effective in reducing code duplication while maintaining functionality.
- Factoring out `EditActions.tsx` supports the goal of creating smaller, reusable components, aligning with Tidy First principles.
- Using `title` attributes for UI elements provides a reliable way to select elements in tests.
- Future updates to icon usage or component refactoring should consider potential test environment compatibility to avoid similar issues.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Maintain consistency in accessible names for UI elements to ensure test reliability.
- Follow TDD and Tidy First principles by separating structural and behavioral changes, and validating with tests after each change.
- Use `title` attributes for interactive elements to support testability.
- Create reusable components to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Reusing components like `AttributeEditor` can significantly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability when applied to repeated UI patterns.
- Factoring out components like `EditActions.tsx` helps in creating a more modular and maintainable codebase.
- Import resolution issues in test environments can often be caused by incorrect aliases or mocks; verifying the existence and correctness of such configurations is crucial.
- Updating test assertions to match the implemented UI structure is essential for maintaining a passing test suite.
- Adding `title` attributes to elements makes tests more robust by providing unique identifiers for selection.
