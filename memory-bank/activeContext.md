# Active Context for Idea Craft Project

## Current Work Focus
- Standardizing icon sizes across the application to ensure visual consistency, particularly for edit-related icons like `Pencil`, `X`, and `Check`.
- Extending Tailwind configuration to include custom utilities for icon sizing, making it easier to maintain consistent styling across components.
- Updating memory bank files to reflect the latest project status and changes as per user request.

## Recent Changes
- Updated icon sizes in `EditActions.tsx`, `ContentBody.tsx`, `ContentTypeTags.tsx`, and `AttributeEditor.tsx` to a uniform `h-4 w-4` for consistency.
- Adjusted hover color styling for `Pencil` icons in `ContentBody.tsx` to match contextual attribute colors (e.g., `text-event` for location, `text-mail` for from and to).
- Extended `tailwind.config.ts` to include custom height and width utilities for icon sizing (`icon-md` set to `1rem`), aiming to factor out repeated `h-4 w-4` specifications.
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `AttributeEditor.tsx` by properly integrating the `editIconClass` prop for custom hover styling.

## Next Steps
- Complete the refactoring of icon size specifications by applying the custom Tailwind utility (`h-icon-md w-icon-md`) across all relevant components to replace hardcoded `h-4 w-4` values.
- Ensure all memory bank files are updated with the latest project status, focusing on `progress.md` to document historical context and pending tasks.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Decision to use Tailwind configuration for custom icon size utilities instead of modifying `global.css`, as per user preference, to maintain consistency with Tailwind's approach.
- Consideration of user feedback on hover effects (`group-hover` vs. `hover`) for icon styling, with readiness to adjust based on user preference.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Maintain thorough documentation in the memory bank to ensure continuity and clarity of project direction after memory resets.
- Adhere to distinct roles for each memory bank file to minimize redundancy and improve information accessibility.
- Follow Tidy First principles by separating structural changes (like icon styling and Tailwind config updates) from behavioral changes.
