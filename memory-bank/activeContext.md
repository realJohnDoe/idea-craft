# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- The `lucide-react` import issue has been resolved by removing the alias to a non-existent mock file in `vitest.config.ts`.
- The `AttributeEditor.tsx` component now correctly imports and uses the `Pencil` icon from `lucide-react`.
- Tests in `AttributeEditor.test.tsx` have been updated to query the edit button by the correct accessible name "Edit".

## Recent Changes
- Removed the alias for `lucide-react` in `vitest.config.ts` to resolve import resolution errors during test runs.
- Uncommented the `Pencil` icon import in `AttributeEditor.tsx`.
- Updated failing tests in `AttributeEditor.test.tsx` to use the correct accessible name for the edit button.
- All tests are now passing with the actual `lucide-react` library in use.

## Next Steps
- Continue with the next task from `progress.md`, which is to use the `AttributeEditor` component to factor out duplicate code in `ContentBody.tsx`.
- Ensure that any further changes related to `lucide-react` are tested thoroughly to prevent regression of import issues.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The decision to remove the mock alias and use the actual `lucide-react` library has proven effective in resolving the import issue.
- Future updates to icon usage should consider potential test environment compatibility to avoid similar issues.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Maintain consistency in accessible names for UI elements to ensure test reliability.
- Follow TDD and Tidy First principles by separating structural and behavioral changes, and validating with tests after each change.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Import resolution issues in test environments can often be caused by incorrect aliases or mocks; verifying the existence and correctness of such configurations is crucial.
- Updating test assertions to match the implemented UI structure is essential for maintaining a passing test suite.
