# Active Context for Idea Craft Project

## Current Work Focus
- Resolved the styling issue with the cancel icon color in `EditActions.tsx` by aligning with the custom `red` color defined in `tailwind.config.ts` as `#E06C75`. The custom color definition was overriding standard Tailwind `text-red-*` classes, causing the icon to appear white until `text-red` was used.
- Investigated button styling for `AttributeEditor.test.tsx`, focusing on size and color adjustments to match adjacent components. The user has confirmed that the current state of `EditActions.tsx` is acceptable.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `EditActions.tsx` to use `text-red` for the cancel icon, resolving the color override issue caused by custom Tailwind color definitions.
- Removed context-specific color classes (`text-event`, `text-mail`) from `ContentBody.tsx` during debugging to prevent color inheritance from parent elements.

## Next Steps
- No immediate changes are required for `EditActions.tsx` as the user has confirmed the file is fine.
- Ready to address any additional styling or functional requirements for the project if requested by the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Custom Tailwind color definitions in `tailwind.config.ts` must be used (e.g., `text-red` instead of `text-red-600`) to ensure consistency with the project's theme.
- Color inheritance from parent components can affect child element styling, requiring careful management of Tailwind classes in parent components like `ContentBody.tsx`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adhere to Tailwind CSS conventions for styling, avoiding non-Tailwind solutions unless absolutely necessary.
- Use custom color names defined in `tailwind.config.ts` (e.g., `text-red`, `text-one-dark-green`) to align with the project's Atom One Dark theme.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Custom color definitions in Tailwind configuration can override standard palette values, necessitating the use of exact custom color names to achieve the desired styling.
- Debugging style overrides requires tracing inheritance from parent components and reviewing configuration files like `tailwind.config.ts` for customizations that impact rendering.
