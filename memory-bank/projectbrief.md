# Project Brief for Idea Craft

## Project Overview
Idea Craft is a productivity tool designed to help users capture, organize, and manage diverse types of content—tasks, events, messages, and notes—in a unified, intuitive platform. The app aims to streamline personal and professional workflows by consolidating fragmented productivity tools into a single, accessible solution.

## Core Goals
- **Unified Content Management:** Provide a single interface for creating, editing, and organizing various content types, reducing the need for multiple apps.
- **Data Portability:** Use markdown as the core format to ensure content is easily exportable and importable, preventing lock-in and supporting integration with other systems.
- **Cross-Device Accessibility:** Enable users to access and manage their content seamlessly across different devices, with a focus on mobile usability.
- **Simplicity and Usability:** Deliver a clean, user-friendly experience that prioritizes ease of use and efficiency in content interaction.

## Scope
- **Initial Phase:** Focus on a client-side web application with local storage for data persistence, supporting offline access without a backend.
- **Content Types:** Support tasks, events, messages, and notes with flexible categorization through frontmatter metadata.
- **Key Features:** Include content creation/editing, type and tag filtering, markdown support with wikilinks, and data import/export capabilities.
- **Future Considerations:** Enhance data management with local directory syncing and explore advanced features like calendar views or markdown editors akin to Notion or Obsidian.

## Target Audience
- Individuals seeking a consolidated productivity tool for personal organization.
- Professionals managing diverse content types in small teams or solo projects.
- Users valuing data portability and markdown for compatibility with other tools.
