# Idea Craft 💡

A unified productivity tool designed to help users manage tasks, events, messages, and notes within a single, intuitive application. Idea Craft breaks down the barriers between different content types by using markdown with frontmatter for flexible data storage and type inference.

## Overview 📋

Idea Craft addresses the problem of fragmented productivity tools by allowing users to create, organize, and transform content seamlessly. Whether it's a task with a deadline, an event, a message, or a note, Idea Craft infers types from frontmatter attributes, enabling fluid categorization without technical constraints.

## Key Features ✨

- **Unified Content Management**: Handle tasks, events, messages, and notes in one app, with the ability to transform content between types effortlessly. 📝
- **Markdown with Frontmatter**: Store data in human-readable markdown files, using YAML frontmatter for metadata like dates, status, or recipients. 📄
- **Type Inference**: Dynamically categorize items based on frontmatter attributes (e.g., a task with a date can be both a `task` and an `event`). 🧠
- **Intuitive UI**: Features a clean interface with components like Navbar, TypeFilter, TagsFilter, ContentList, and SelectedItemView for easy navigation. 🖥️
- **Advanced Interactions**: Supports wikilink previews when typing `[[` (with auto-closing braces), inline task rendering, and editable frontmatter attributes with visible edit icons. ⚙️
- **Local Storage**: Persists data in the browser's local storage, with support for importing and exporting markdown files. 💾
